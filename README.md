## Infinite Flight Fuel Burn Calculator/Database

This is a v2.0 for Andrew's original Infinite Flight [fuel burn database](https://community.infiniteflight.com/t/your-ultimate-guide-to-infinite-flight-fuel-burn-fuel-calculator-40-aircraft/721974).<br>

Since Andrew is a CS major specializing in data science (pronounced "nerd"), he decided to take this project to the next level and incorporate it into a web application. Being an SE major myself, I offered to help him with the technical aspect of this project. While this is a collaboration between the two of us, the original numbers and math are the sole work of Andrew, and all credit for the data collection and processing goes to him.<br>

Please be aware that this project is currently very much work in progress, and has nothing to do with any of our schoolwork or extracurricular activities; it is a *side project*.<br>
